BIG QUESTION: how to do proximity searching?

Looking into:
  PostGIS (spatial and geographic objects for postgres) https://postgis.net/
  MySQL spatial objects  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/spatial-function-reference.html
  LocalSOLR http://www.gissearch.com/localsolr

Tentative conclusion: Just hide it behind an abstract API that does
proximity searches.  For the demo backend, do the simplest thing that could
possibly work.  (Say, assume the earth is flat!)

Consider this:

         * Searching for and returning contact information for opted-in owners of other pets within a
           5-mile radius.

This could mean:

* Other pets which are _now_ within 5 miles

* Other pets which were within 5 miles of your pet at some point in
  the recent past

* Other pets which were recently within 5 miles of somewhere your pet
  has been recently

  (Use case: My pet was at park X on Tuesday, your pet was at park X
  on Friday, let's arrange to meet on the same day, next time.)
