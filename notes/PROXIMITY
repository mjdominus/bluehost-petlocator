BIG QUESTION: how to do proximity searching?

Looking into:
  PostGIS (spatial and geographic objects for postgres) https://postgis.net/
  MySQL spatial objects  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/spatial-function-reference.html
  LocalSOLR http://www.gissearch.com/localsolr

Tentative conclusion: Just hide it behind an abstract API that does
proximity searches.  For the demo backend, do the simplest thing that could
possibly work.  (Say, assume the earth is flat!)
