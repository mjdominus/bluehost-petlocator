pet -> pet info (name, etc.)

pet -> pet collar ID

pets <-> owners

owner -> non-PII (service level, opt-in, etc.)  (use dynamo?)
owner -> PII / billing

# Don't need this, the mobile API will be able to resolve it
# and send us the lat/long; see
# https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geolocation/overview
# for example
cell tower -> location

# Do we store pet IDs or pet collar IDs in the DB?
pet id + location + date    triple

# Is this in SQL?  It will be large and frequently churning.  Dynamo
  might be a better choice.   What is the key?    The pet ID is surely
  the primary key.  Can we use the location as a range key somehow?
  Maybe geohashes?  If geohashes, could we treat time as a fourth
  geographic coordinate to do proximity-in-time searches?
