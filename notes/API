* boring administrative stuff (billing etc.)
  ** create user
  ** set service level
  ** update contact info

* pets
  * create pet (owner, name, additional info)
  * (dis)associate collar with pet (constraint: at most one pet per collar)

* location
  * record pet location triple
  * collar id, time → location
  * location, time, radius, t-interval → other collars in
    temporospatial region
  * collar id → recent locations, sorted (paged)

  A lot of these functions that return a pet or a collar ID could return
  a { "collar": id, "pet": id } pair.
